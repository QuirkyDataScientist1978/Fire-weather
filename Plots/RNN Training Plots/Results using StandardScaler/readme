The H500, ERC and other variables were standardized using StandardScaler
The inverted values for the predicted ERC, as shown in the plots, are incorrect,
I'm not sure why the inverse_transform isn't working.
In the file names, cv=2 means the validation_split in the model training is 0.2,
cv=3 means 0.3,
do means dropout, do=5 means 0.5, 0001 means 0.0001
Epochs=300 unless otherwise specified in the file name
Batch=512 unless otherwise specified in the file name

Typical results with the standard scaler:
Train Score: 0.37 MSE (0.61 RMSE)
Test Score: 0.46 MSE (0.68 RMSE)

Typical results with the minmax scaler:
Train Score: 0.00 MSE (0.07 RMSE)
Test Score: 0.01 MSE (0.07 RMSE)
