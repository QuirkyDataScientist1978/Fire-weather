# Fire-weather
Fire weather prediction in OR and WA state using synoptic weather variables geopotential height at 500 hPa (H500), surface pressure reduced to mean sea level (PMSL), and convective available potential energy (CAPE). Longitude and latitude gradients for both H500 and PMSL are used, not the downloaded point values, as the gradients drive surface level winds leading to high-risk fire conditions. CAPE is added to include the effect of thunderstorm activity which delivers dry electrical storms in the summer time, causing the majority of burned acreage during a fire season.
